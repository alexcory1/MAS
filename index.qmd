# Welcome

This repository serves as a **central hub for my work in the Masters of Applied Statistics program** at Iowa State University. It contains my projects and notes taken during my degree.

---

## Repository Structure

Each class will have a folder in which work from said class will be saved. There is also a folder for notes, which contains markdown files for all of my notes taken which can be viewed in either Obsidian Notes or a markdown viewer of your choice.
